# 'Night' Concept Website (Ongoing)

This is a React website about the 'Night' concept. In this website, I try to explore how animations, colours, pictures and designs can depict this concept.

## First Page:
<strong>Menu</strong>
This is the main menu of the website. It contains a navigation bar and it uses parallax scrolling effect.

<strong>Explore</strong>:
Reasong why everyone should enjoy the night.

<strong>Gallery</strong>:
A gallery of night photos for inspiration.

<strong>Contact</strong>: 
Visitors can fill in their information and stay updated with the 'Night' concept. Currently, the 'submit' button is not functional.

<strong>Animation</strong>:
A showcase of animations with car, stars, moon and fallen objects at night.

## Second Page:
<strong>Scroll</strong>:
Another version of Menu component. This component uses React 'Parallax' library.

<strong>CardText</strong>:
Another version of Explore component. This component uses card flipping effect on hover.

<strong>PhotoView</strong>:
Another version of gallery. This component uses side-by-side photo display.
